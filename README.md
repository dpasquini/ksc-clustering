# ksc-clustering-r
"Toy implementation" in R of K-Spectral Centroid Clustering (K-SC) by Jaewon Yang (crucis@stanford.edu) and Jure Leskovec (jure@cs.stanford.edu). K-SC finds clusters of time series that share a distinct temporal pattern. K-SC is an iterative algorithm similar to the classical K-means clustering algorithm but enables efficient centroid computation under a scale and shift invariant distance metric.
